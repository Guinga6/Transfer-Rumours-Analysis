If we want to compete with the top teams, this is what we need to do—sign Gyökeres and bring in a new manager. Besides, starting in 2025, every team in Europe will be playing up to 70 games due to the new Champions League format, and the FIFA Club World Cup will also be introduced next year.",

    "Why can't they ask for 100 million? After all, he is currently the best striker in the world",
    " @Adam-l2g  best striker? I don’t know what to say anymore 😆",
    " @izzatasyraf314    He score minimum 1 goal every game, literally",
    " @Adam-l2g  best striker in Liga Portugal not in the world",
    " @izzatasyraf314    So according to your logic, Haaland is the best striker in England and not in the world?",
    " @Adam-l2g  well depends on who you ask. I never say haaland is the best but based on records & the numbers & the league he has play which is Bundesliga & premiere league that are better than Liga Portugal so yeah he is better than gyokeres. Is he the best? Some will argue Harry Kane is the best but he never win big trophies even though the numbers are amazing & I much prefer Kane than haaland because he is more like 9.5 which can score and assist as well",
    " @Adam-l2g delusion at its finest 🤡🤣",
    "If they need to sell they will lower, why would they if they don’t. Their financials must be pretty strong from the sales over the last decade",
    "Our finances are in great condition, we don’t need necessarily to sell. So Gyökeres release clause is 100M, if any club want him, they have to pay that or close to that, otherwise his staying at Sporting, simple as that.",
    " @Jcz17  that’s why no team have yet to go for gyokeres because financially 100m nowadays most clubs are not just gonna spend like 100m easily like last time. They are more aware of financial fair play. Like it or not sooner or later they gonna drop the value of the player just like Napoli did to osimhen.",
    "⁠ @izzatasyraf314 His clause was 60M, apparently according to the news (some might be fake) some teams tried for around 40M, we rejected those offers, because obviously his worth a lot more and there’s not many strikers like Gyökeres Like I said, we don’t need to sell, so his release clause will stay at 100M. We Sporting fans and supporters are very calm about his situation. Have a nice day",
    "⁠ @izzatasyraf314 Sporting doesn’t want to sell. The longer he stays the better. Even selling for 100M would be worse than keeping him, since I can’t see any player we could buy who could come remotely close to what he offers. Unfortunately that’s the release clause so we’d be forced to sell him if some teams pays that amount. Paying 100M would be doing a favour to our rivals Benfica and Porto, not to us.",
    " @sousa447  yeah let’s see if there’s any team right now would be willing to meet that 100m valuation. It’s a big risk. Not every big signing works. Some may think about Darwin Nunez. Big money transfer but doesn’t really perform as well as people expected in premiere league. But I guess that’s why nobody pay 100m for gyokeres yet in the summer because most club are afraid to invest that big unless you are a big name player like mbappe, Vinicius, haaland, Kane, Bellingham, Cole palmer, yamal, which is still young like gyokeres but in terms of popularity & marketability are huge compared to gyokeres right now.",
    " @izzatasyraf314  Hopefully no one pays. Benfica and Porto fans have been praying for someone to pay the release clause for a long time now. Obviously Sporting would much rather keep him.\nAlso, Darwin wasn’t even remotely close to being as good as Gyokeres is in Portugal. People who compare them might as well say they’ve not watched either of them playing in Portugal.",
    " @sousa447  yeah gyokeres numbers are better than Nunez so he may be turning up better than Nunez if he play in premiere league. Hopefully gyokeres will do well in champions league and who knows maybe if he score a lot of goals in champions league bigger team in Europe gonna pay that 100m next summer. So far only a few teams have the financial to pay that kind of money. Only times will tell whether those clubs feels it’s worth it to pay 100m or not.",
    "You all can’t talk about Osimhen as ignoring  all about the story!",
    "Crazy how people pretent to tell clubs what to do or what they can or can’t do…",
    "Fewer clubs can afford paying 100m for one single player",
    "We weren't counting on letting him go as soon as possible, it was planned like that (i.e., virtually no one giving a 100M). The Portuguese league isn't bad by any means, but we're still at 7th place or something. The only way to keep good players is normally by having high release clauses. And since we're currently not desperate for money,...\nFor a little longer, Gyokeres stays - he's happy, Sporting is happy, and the coach; Ruben Amorin, is able to get the best out of Sporting's players - a big added value for everyone.",

He has spent his entire career there and won everything with the club but he is 26 years old, right before his prime and if there is a chance to play for Real and win the Champions League every year I can see why he would want to do that.\nHe is a Liverpool Legend either way and I hope the fans will see it like that as well",

  "transcription": " But this is not something new in terms of how the Almadrid work. We know how the Almadrid are always attentive to top players in general. Hey guys, welcome back on the channel for please remember here is always to keep you posted on the transfer market today guys. We touch on Real Madrid, Liverpool, Trent Alexander and Arnold, many things to say about Barcelona also with the injury of Marc Andre Terstegat and Victor Gjokres. Let's jump into it together. And so guys, let me start today's video by mentioning a deal completed, finally completed for Real Madrid. If you are following here on the channel, you remember since August, how we mentioned the situation of Ferland Mendy at Real Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti is the name to mention because Carlo Ancelotti loves Ferland Mendy, Carlo Ancelotti considers Ferland Mendy an underrated player, the best left back in the world in his opinion, in public and in private in many conversations he had with the club and now everything is signed for Ferland Mendy to stay at Real Madrid 2027. So three year deal for Ferland Mendy pay rise, so a higher salary for the French left back and Real Madrid are very happy with this deal because similar to Andre Lunin situation he was out on 13 summer 2025. So potentially Real Madrid in general were going to lose the player on a free transfer they have been able to negotiate a new contract to keep the player at the club to make the manager happy because Ancelotti again is a big fan of Ferland Mendy and so Mendy staying at Real Madrid 2027 everything signed. Who is in Real Madrid least in terms of club being attentive to the situation is Trent Alexander Arnold, the fantastic player of Liverpool we know since March we are mentioning about the interest of Real Madrid but this is not something new in terms of how Real Madrid work we know how Real Madrid are always attentive to top players in general especially if these top players are still not extending their contrasts at their clubs and so Trent Alexander Arnold for sure is a player they really like and the player they are monitoring but as of today we can't mention a negotiation and a discussion between Trent Alexander Arnold and Real Madrid. The priority for Trent is Liverpool and for the first time in the last hours Trent spoke in public about his situation at Liverpool his contrast situation he said I want to win trophies this is what is going to drive my future then he keeps mentioning about Liverpool being very happy with Arnaz Lotte also mentioned my contract extensions and Liverpool since I was a kid till today have always been silent never been in the media and this one will be discussed also in a silent way too so this was the message from Trent what does it mean guys means that Trent will have negotiations and we'll keep discussing with Liverpool is about the project is about the idea they have is about what they want to do at the club for the next years obviously as for all people in football and out of football is also going to be about money but the main focus is about the project and so Trent Alexander Arnold and Liverpool will have conversations the priority will be for Liverpool Liverpool will have the chance to extend the contact of Trent let's see if they can reach an agreement on the project and on the financials with the player Real Madrid will keep following the situation at the moment again no negotiations but just being attentive to a big potential opportunity because Trent is obviously probably one of the biggest if not the biggest player out of contact in summer 2025 who had the chance to leave his club in the summer transfer window was Rafinha yes because Rafinha has always been really attractive to several clubs not only Europe you remember when Barcelona signed in from Leeds United there was interest from Chelsea interest from Arsenal always been a player of interest at Tottenham they always always appreciated him but last summer the club really trying to sign Rafinha was in Saudi because in Saudi Pro League they presented a very important proposal to Rafinha in terms of money to bring him to Saudi Pro League Rafinha's answer has been very clear no thanks he was approached two times in two different moments of the summer transfer window by Saudi clubs and he always said no why because Rafinha really loves Barcelona Rafinha wants to succeed at Barcelona Rafinha wants to do something important for Barça and the beginning of the season has been fantastic for Rafinha under Anci Flick the numbers goals assist the leadership the importance also in the dressing room they are very happy with Rafinha but credits to Rafinha who said no to big money from Saudi to stay at Barcelona to keep pushing at Barcelona and now performing in a very good way under Anci Flick so this is the new life for Rafinha at Barça with a new manager and also with the player turning down important opportunities in Saudi good luck to Marc Andrejter Stegen this is one of the bad news of the weekend injury of Rodri and the super serious injury of Marc Andrejter Stegen who will be out for something around seven eight months it will depend on the recovery process but for sure it's a long injury is a serious injury for Marc Andrejter Stegen Barça immediately understood the situation after the moment the sad moment we saw on the pitch for Ter Stegen against Villarreal was a situation now internal discussions are going also involving Anci Flick Barça want to decide with the manager whether they want to bring in a new goalkeeper Claudio Bravo was speaking today mentioning about being available to come out of retirement in case Barça calls him there are several free agent goalkeepers who are now waiting for a call from Barcelona but now it's on Barça to decide whether they want to stay with the current squad till January and maybe do something in a general transfer window or do something immediately only free agents so let's see what Barcelona will decide to do but what we can say is that Ter Stegen is really hoping to return for the final part of the season so to do something similar to what Thibaut Courtois obviously is a different injury but to what Thibaut Courtois did for El Madrid last season out for 80% 85% of the season and then back for the final crucial games because Ter Stegen really believes that Barça will be there will be competing in the final part of the season for important titles and so Ter Stegen will do his best to return as soon as possible to help Barcelona waiting to see what kind of decision the club will make and then guys guess who scored at the weekend Victor Giocares again and again and again a brace for sporting and I keep receiving many questions on the general transfer window but maybe something can happen in January for Giocares he keeps scoring goals he also scored in Champions League so many questions about that guys what I can tell you about Giocares is that sporting as they were very clear in the summer transfer window they remain very clear in public and in private also now on Victor Giocares they want 100 million euros paid that is closed or the player stays here this is their position today obviously then in next summer we will see many things can change we will see and we will follow the situation closely because Giocares is clearly one of the best number nine's around Europe but at the moment the position of sporting remains clear in public and in private they keep insisting on 100 million euros released close for Giocares and the player is doing fantastic the player is attracting the interest of several clubs let me say that already several clubs were interested in the summer but the player was considered too expensive not because of his value but if you look at that this summer no club invested crazy money on number nine so the domino of number nine's around Europe was never really there in the summer transfer window 2024 in 2025 we will see because Giocares keeps performing sporting are super happy with him but now full focus on the pitch no time for talks also for January sporting insist release close all the player is expected to stay at the club and so guys let me know your thoughts on all these stories from Victor Giocares which club should go for him but also Rafinha markandretersteghe and Barca to sign or not sign anyone and then do something in January and then Trent Alexander Ardon of the Liverpool Real Madrid any other solution what's your feeling guys let me know your thoughts on all these stories remember to like this video
